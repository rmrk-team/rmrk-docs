title: "Soulbound 2.0 NFTs: Non-transferables"
---

Non-transferable NFTs, popularized by Vitalik Buterin as
[soulbound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html), are NFTs that are useful for
reputation tracking: they get added to addresses but are non-transferable, so they cannot be sold
and permanently assign some modifier to a given address.

In RMRK this is an especially interesting concept as NFTs can be non-transferable inside another
transferable NFT, dubbed **Soulbound 2.0**.

Thus, an NFT like a [Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app) can have non-transferable gems inside it
that give it long lasting benefits and bonuses, but cannot be removed, alongside some other tradable
NFTs as well.

This can be further utilized when dealing with
[in-game avatars and skill systems](/usecases/charprog). A skill can be learned and "installed" into
an avatar's brain, but cannot be removed.

In addition to a simple on/off flag, the Kusama implementation (see below) supports temporary
transferability and temporary non-transferability which allows a minter to specify that an NFT
should be movable only after a certain number of blocks, or not before a certain number of blocks
has elapsed.

## Examples

As mentioned in the concept of [equippables](/lego25-equippable), a very good example of using
non-transferable NFTs is when using them as reputation indicators, but not on accounts as documented
in the aforementioned [soulbound post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html), but
inside other transferable or non-transferable NFTs.

- [Zeitgeist](https://zeitgeist.pm), a prediction market chain, will
  [give each chain user an avatar](https://app.zeitgeist.pm/), and give them reputational (non
  transferable) tokens to equip, based on their performance in their prediction markets.

- [Citizend](https://www.citizend.xyz/) is a public no-lottery project launchpad as a DAO, and will
  have performance based reputation tokens (non transferables) for the user avatars which, based on
  their attained reputation, will have better opportunities and more prominent votes in governance
  later on.

- [Governance Rewards in Kusama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpT7hubqzFQ) rewards people with
  trophies for every on-chain referendum they vote in, which they can equip onto their
  “reputational” shelf. This not only visually indicates your on-chain activity in the world’s
  biggest DAOs (Kusama and Polkadot) but also serves really well for other apps, e.g. you read that
  information cross-chain from a Defi hub like Acala, and maybe your reputation is now enough
  collateral to get an undercollateralized loan.

- [Phala World](https://phala.world) tracks a user’s web3 activity, and
  [turns it](https://phala.world/claim/) into non-transferable reputation tokens inside of Phala
  World game avatars which can only be leveled up this way. So instead of leveling up by playing the
  game, you level up by being a good web3 citizen, which turns into non-transferable skills and
  experience for your avatar.

- [Kabocha](https://rmrk.link/kabocha) Seeds are central to the governance of Kabocha, representing
  evolving roles, rights and reputation in the network and future Publiks. Seeds are unique,
  non-transferable assets that grow based on continuing contributions to the project. They will
  define how you build identity, your voting power and access within future Publik domains.

- [InvArch](https://rmrk.link/invarch) is a blockchain which uses RMRK NFTs for IP management, and a
  license is inherently a non-transferable NFT as part of another NFT, along with other idea-related
  information. So non-transferable NFTs act as “reputation” tokens for ideas there too.

- [Skybreach](https://skybreach.app) uses non-transferable NFTs as NFT brains for NFT avatars, and
  NFT skills inside of those brains which can be equipped into slots, as well as NFT personalities,
  NFT crafting recipes, NFT pathfinding algorithms and more. For example, a character at level 2
  might have 2 skill slots in their NFT brain, but 5 skills. So now they have to choose which skills
  to make active by equipping 2 of 5. They can level up the character to get a new asset on this
  NFT brain which has 3 slots, so at level 3 they can equip 3 of 5 skills, and so on. This is how
  [Skybreach Chunkies](https://rmrk.gitbook.io/kanaria-skybreach/fundamentals/skybreach-avatars/chunkies)
  work and is further explored in [Character Progression systems](/usecases/charprog).

All of the above projects are also part of the [global item economy](/econ) made possible only with
RMRK, so that they can have interchangeable accessories that are cross-collection compatible, and
therefore get new utility over time, all the time.

## Implementations

The implementations below lead directly to code. For examples of how to utilize them to mint your
own NFTs, please refer to the sidebar section for each implementation subtype.
