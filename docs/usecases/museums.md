In their current state, museums and galleries have limited use for NFTs. The occasional
[ticket](ticketing.md) or simple digital representation of a real life exhibit are just about all
the options at their disposal, so the lack of adoption by such institutions does not come as a
surprise.

With Modular NFTs, specifically [multi-asset NFTs](/lego2-multi-resource.md), we finally have meaningful
utility to offer them.

Let's assume we have an exhibit called Mona Lisa. A museum could mint NFTs which simultaneously
contain:

1. The digital version of the painting
2. A short movie about the history of the painting, where it's been and where it came from
3. A multi-language audio-track for the gallery tour around this particular painting
4. A museum-shop voucher for a Mona Lisa high quality poster

These are not separate NFTs - these are all alternative assets of one NFT. The NFT is made into a
rich multi-media experience and is given true utility, versus just being a digital copy of an analog
painting as with NFTs 1.0.

Taking things a step further, another asset could be a random [puzzle piece](/usecases/puzzles),
drawn randomly on purchase from the purchase-block blockhash. This then gives the NFT
secondary-market value, along with earning the museum or gallery royalties, because the experience
is gamified - visitors now race to collect all the puzzle pieces to compose a master puzzle NFT and
win an additional prize like, for example, an exclusive private viewing of an upcoming exhibition.

All this is natively supported by the RMRK standards and available today using a Modular NFT
marketplace such as [Singular](https://singular.app).
