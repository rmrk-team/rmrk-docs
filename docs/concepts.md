title: "RMRK Modular NFTs Concepts"
---

The RMRK Modular NFTs Concepts are divided into RMRK legos and RMRK concepts. Legos are primitives that
make up complex _use cases_ and enable certain _concepts_.

## RMRK Legos

- [Nestable NFTs](/lego1-nested)
  - The ability for any NFT to contain other RMRK NFT
- [Multi-asset NFTs](/lego2-multi-resource)
  - The ability for an NFT to vary its output depending on the context it is being loaded in
- [Equippable NFTs](/lego25-equippable)
  - The ability for NFTs to equip owned NFTs in order to gain extra utility or change their
    appearance, also known as composable NFTs
- [On-chain emotes](/lego3-emote)
  - The social mechanic of sending and rendering received emotes (emoji reactions) on any NFT
- [Conditional Rendering](/lego4-conditional-rendering)
  - The ability for an NFT to have different client-side outputs depending on some on-chain or
    off-chain values
- [NFTs as DAOs](/lego5-dao)
  - The ability for NFTs to be fractionalized and community governed

## RMRK Concepts

- [Non-transferable NFTs - Soulbound 2.0](/nontransferable)
  - The ability for NFTs to be **bound** to another NFT or to an account address
- [Provable Digital Scarcity](/scarcity)
  - The concept that an NFT is only available in one place at one time, enforced by the blockchain's
    security.
- [Ownership of Experience](/ownershipxp)
  - The ability to evolve an NFT over time and keep the experience of interacting with an environment bound to the NFT's value, contextually and on-chain.

## Use Cases

The Concepts are put to use in the Use Cases:

- [Cross-game skins](/usecases/cross_game_skins)
  - Defeating the previously valid anti-NFT argument from the game development community
- [Ticketing](/usecases/ticketing)
  - Using multi-asset NFTs for fully decentralized ticketing solutions for events etc.
- [Revealable NFTs](/usecases/revealable)
  - "Hatching" NFTs after a sale in a fully decentralized way, without relying on a central metadata server
- [Metadata Backup](/usecases/backups)
  - Backing up metadata in a fully decentralized way to be fully immune to server or storage-blockchain downtime
- [Mixed Media NFTs](/usecases/mixedmedia)
  - NFTs that are multiple media types at the same time: an eBook with a PDF and an audio file at the same time, for example, all in the same NFT
- [NFT Evolution](/usecases/evolution)
  - Evolving NFTs to give them utility over time. Ideal for games.
- [Character Progression Systems](/usecases/charprog)
  - Taking evolution further and adding true RPG mechanics for your in-game avatars
